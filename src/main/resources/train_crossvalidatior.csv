2316,love-is-worth,2007,del-the-funky-homosapien,Hip-Hop,"Okay

2375,deep-blue-you,2010,8mm,Electronic,"Once I thought the sun would rise again
Once I thought the tide would turn
Once I believed that sunlight could guide me home
Now I know that light is old and stars are gone
Now I know Im lost, lost, in the deep blue you
Now I know Im lost, lost, in the deep blue you
Once I thought that gravity would hold its ground
Once I thought that wishes came true
Once I dreamed on dandelions and fairytales
Now I know that weeds and throws can all be blown away
Now I know Im lost, lost, in the deep blue you
Now I know Im lost, lost, in the deep blue you
I can fall but theres no down
I can scream but theres no sound
I can sink but I cant drown
Where others cant be found
I know the facts but thats not proof
Every lie becomes a truth what am I supposed to do?
I thought I could count on you
I can fall but theres no down
I can scream but theres no sound
I can sink but I cant drown
Where others cant be found
I know the facts but thats no proof
Once I thought the sun would rise again
Once I thought the tide would turn
Once I believed that sunlight could guide me home
Once I thought the sun would rise again
Once I thought the tide would turn
Once I believed that sunlight could guide me home"

No time for liberation, baby, its time to let the beasty out"
