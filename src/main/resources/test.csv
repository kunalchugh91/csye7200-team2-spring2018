""A problem? Yeah I got a problem.
Cause. . . I been waitin for how
long for this shit to come out?
Now this the tricks and treats shit, ya know?
Now all y'all motherphukkers that listen to it,
and I'm sick and tired of
this shit, because...
all you wack motherphukkers keep comin out with records!
And guess what I'm about to do?
Guess what I'm 'bout to do?!
I'm 'bout to catch you out there. . .
and chopyourmotherphukkinheadoff!!!""
Who's the jester?
Under pressure?
Not me!
I hate emcees a lot, flee
Escape,
I'll tape your mouth closed
Dispose of your flows
The ones that you chose
Don't compare
Where is your other shit?
When I discover it
I'm shovin that shit
Right back in your mouth,
And start with another kick
Good riddance
Suds of blood like the Red Sea splashes
When I smash kids
Ashes and cremations
We wait in
The torture chamber
Of course you blame a
Brother like Del for murder
Word up, on a mission
It's in my heart
Rippin fools apart
You dart and dash
But I'll remove your heart fast
With my bare hands
Stashed it into their plans
I'd like to see it pulsate in my palm
Squeeze it, squish it
Eat it with a biscuit
For breakfast
You're next if
You step with
Your bright ideas
I might apply years
Of rhymin
Til the time when
I blind men
With a flash of light
I'll blast you right
In the corneas
I'm warnin ya's
So take heed to that
Before you bleed, in fact
I'm keepin niggaz outta my head
Outta my head
Instead,
they bled
They dead,
call the Feds
[Chorus (4x):]
""This is how you're treated (this is how you're treated)
When my rhyme's completed
Niggaz get defeated (defeated!)""
I wanna push and shove
Take off the kid gloves
Tearin the terrorist
Where a fist
Holds a dagger
Stick it in your stomach and drag your
Insides across the ground
Get 'em at the lost and found
At the police station
I'm patient
I won't get you yet
So no sweat
You're no threat
I bet I can belt your brain
When my scalpel felt your brain
You convulsed
No pulse
We lost him
Cost him his life
Phukkin around
It's too easy to buck 'em down
Let 'em drown
Face down in a toilet
Take his brain and boil it
Watchin who I tell 'cause they'll spoil it
They might reveal
My anger is real
Keep your lips sealed
Or yo might be the next to keel over
or Murderous
Refer to us
When you feel the need
To bleed your chicken feed
Yeah, plead for mercy
Before I burst free
I'm blood thirsty
When it comes to who disturbs me
I make your life complicated
Emcees get ground and grated
While they waited
In the lobby
It's my hobby
It'll prob'ly be me
Who sees your knees
Buckle-
Phuk you
And your duck crew
I'ma pluck you from safety
When I break free
[CHORUS (4x)]"

Fare weather associates
You better, watch how close they get

You better, watch how close they get

[Del]
We all know FWA's, how they lay
cause they figure if you're bumpin the pays
In the long run, and it's all fun in their eyes
They must be on one how, they prepare lies
Get up close make you think, you the host of the ceremonies
Why you ain't peepin like a doggy mark his territory
They're never there for me when I need a little boost
Because of who you are, they can get a little juice
Then they like to seemingly leans up on your shoulders
Otherwise he's steppin on toes gettin over
Flappin his molars talkin 'bout he owe you
and every time he smoke, he don't show you no love
And be the first fool with his lips on the blunt
If he persists to front I'ma commenced to dump
Be careful when you make a little something that's yours
Cause a lot of these predators want yours to be theirs
Or at least own a share just by bein there
I be on some hermit skit, and fools think I'm square now
There's an interesting way to look at it
I look at them as bein fake, the way they took advantage
Speaking on the crooks of the planet, who claim they got game
Yeah you the game and they the hunter; just one more

2325,meet-cleofis-randolph-the-patriarch,2007,del-the-funky-homosapien,Hip-Hop,"What's happening? I keep my dreadlocks in a napkin ring
Rap and sing Unlike the homogeneous clones
I'm into earth tones, birth stones and erogenous zones
The more ticklish the more you have
Sitting on the curb of what used to be the burbs
And before that was Canarcie, I'm a disturbed and bitter herb
Like saltwater and parsley, mics crawl up, tights fall down
That's my mnemonic voice stalactite slash stalagmite
You may have this Maglite, it survived the apocalypse
And for the fragile force of an agile horse
Here's a handful of very special chocolate chips"
2328,dont-forget-the-bass,2007,del-the-funky-homosapien,Hip-Hop,"I'm ready for action, packing provisions of visions
Verbally, every word will be enhanced
With the bass that'll put you in a trance
Some dance, come take a chance
Del won't do you wrong
I've been in the rap game too long to falter
I rock like Gibraltar
Make you kneel to the butt like an altar
We move to prove that this is improved, when you're at-water
Caught em with vibration that soothes your back like massages
Before you can park your car in garages
It'll be just for riders, listening to 'Rock The Bells'
You can barely hear the vocals
Mixing is important, getting the public into chokeholds
Hip hop homo's will do well to know this
It ain't about who's the dopest
It's who gets the fan's focus upon you
When they feel what the song do
I think I'm onto something, when I got my shit pumping
I remember, when they were satisfied with just lyrics
Now, if the music 's flat
I can barely stand to hear it
And my rhymes are impeccable and you can't dissect my flow
With music sounding like it's out of tin cans
Just wretch the whole vibe and stride for perfection
Why you think they call this a profession? Hey
[Chorus: x2]
Can't forget the bass, the bottom got em crawling to the wall man
We got cassettes, CD's and LP's
DJ's for days, whatever you do
Give it your all, cause that's what pays
I just love when I can hear the bump pleading to the walls
In the halls, coming from the record stores in the malls
A beat with walls I like that
It bites back and strikes back
At niggaz who are wack, 'cause
Back in the day when hip hop was just developing
It was back in the day
We should be relishing in experience
All you newcomers better be leery cause
Hieroglyphics got the bump
And it ain't mysterious
[Chorus]
This don't apply to the niggaz who salved
And fell out of their fam base
Trying to chase the big bucks
It sucks, I know, when your heroes want to appear to hoes
Supermacho! And watch the whole role and image of a mic champion
To the fam base it simply can't be done
'Cause they're your folks when you don't get the prop shit
They know you got the top shit and in it only for profit
But since we on the topic, let me drop it
We need to stop this segregation of hip hop
Talking 'bout fuck the east coast, and fuck the west
He's sold out, cause someone either sings a notion in the chorus
What is real hip hop then? Only the shit you listen to
Everything else pretending, I'm sending a message to my fam base
Fuck this is hip hop and this is rap, it came from the same place
And there's a place for everything including hieroglyphics
And we gonna come with it, as long as y'all with it
'Cause the fam base is like a legion
For one cause, we want the dope shit cause
The other got flossed ??? Now
I'm a fan who likes a lot of different things
I differentiate with music just to spread my wings
I always do my best, that's why the fans love me
Not some crime shit, so I can pop bubbly
We all got some preferences, that's just how it goes
But when you see there's an effort being made, don't turn up your nose
Turn up the bass, race to go and buy it
Some of y'all love it - don't you, don't deny it
[Chorus]"

Nowhere on that street
White fire in your soul
White fire and you're out of control
White fire, baby, it's a ducktail heat
You drivin' in the fast lane
With the handbrake on
Changed a pot of gold for a pot of stone
Livin' in a shit house
Where the power's gone
You can have a dollar for that useless telephone

Nowhere on them feet

423,where-gods-once-rode,2011,demonaz,Metal,"Once shadows called I saddled my horse
To the heights I rode over misty mountains
Through days of cold I battled by the sword
From wars blood I drank the flaming breath of strife
The gods were young none ruled under the sky
At the end of worlds began the time of alliance
Forsworn to gold, men sold their sword to kings
Steel were made for those above the din of battle
I see my ride where gods once rode
I see my ride where gods once rode
Great fathers of the sky, fathers of the gods
And the mighty mountain I ride under heavy skies
For the will of iron and the pride of my kind
Looked in the fire of thy doom
The prophecies were all true
Now the world is ending to
The end of days shall come soon
I see my ride where gods once rode
I see my ride where gods once rode"

Gods live on to battle kings live under sigh
Warriors hunger blood with death in the eye
