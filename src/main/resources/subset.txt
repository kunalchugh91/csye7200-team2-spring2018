On this recording, music specifically created for its pleasurable effects upon your mind, body and emotions is mixed with a warm orange colored liquid. Your body is now a glass container. You can smell the orange colored liquid, for the deeper you go, the deeper you go. And if there's extra saliva there, swallow it and take yourself down deeper and deeper. Deeper and deeper, and deeper, and deeper. Choose. I will be your guide in this journey, and I hope to be of help without intruding any more than is absolutely necessary. You may just possibly detect from my voice that I am Irish, and now I leap forward in time. The answer is blowing in the... I am calm and calm. I am relaxed and relaxed. I am the loop that goes 'round and 'round in your head, flowing warmth. Whoever you think you presently are, thank you. Hmmm... it's far out. It's far out.

Listen carefully... shhh. I want to tell you a story about Hip Hop. Hello little Hip Hop. The flowers liked Hip Hop, and Hip Hop liked the flowers. (Yes.) He lived with his sister, Skip Hop (La la la...) and his brother, Slide Hop. (Hey.) He never rests. He beats and whirrs and whirrs so fast that you can't tell what he looks like. (Thump thump, prrrrrr, click click, quack.) Little Hip Hop started to hop, Skip Hop didn't know when they would ever stop. Hip Hop for breakfast, lunch and dinner. Look at all the pretty flowers... (Acht, zeven, zes, grapefruit.) One day, Hip Hop took a deep breath, shut his eyes, and jumped... ""ahhhhh!"" Poor Hip Hop, there was was, right in your house... ooooh. (""Be careful!"", ""Hello Canada!"", ""...like Buddhists"", ""That's all-natural."", ""Nein!"", ""Gezichts-massage."") ""I closed my eyes and jumped until... Thump! I didn't mean to hop into your home, really I didn't!"" One small tear came. ""Stop crying little Hip Hop, I'm glad you came to see me. I get lonesome with no one to make me laugh. Ho ho ho!"" And off they went with a hop and a hip, a skip and a slide, all happy inside. Their heads bobbed up and down... How funny he looks, jumping up and down, whirling in the air... and the flowers love him. He's always around some flowers. Now you see the trouble little Hip Hop got into. It was all because he didn't look where he hopped... and even the flowers talk to each other, like people do, but the sounds they make are different. Listen carefully, and try to understand what they say. "

842	group-autogenics-ii	2010	the-books	Electronic	"Putting your body on the line here, so tuning in now to the feet. You might try lifting them up towards the ears, and when you feel comfortable with it, allowing your eyes to close gently, in your mind's eye. Your being merges with the garbage, becomes one with it, so that all your energies in this moment are held in awareness by the smells, and remembering that there is no one right way to doing the dishes. And let go completely of the question of time. When this happens, as an experiment, see if you can float on a rubber raft into a big pot of boredom, letting it all cook in your mind's eye, where it cooks all by itself, stirring it, perhaps, every once and a while. Is that ok with you? Stare at yourself in the mirror until you feel a burning sensation. Now remove your head completely, your head is floating in the air. With your left brain, close your eyes. Stick out your tongue to the universe, and imagine your own peculiar vibration. Deeper, deeper, deeper. Several thousand years of external happiness and exaltation of our psyche. Free we are from complexities. Relaxing, relaxing, relaxing, relaxing... As we go down the elevator, as you continue to listen to the sound of my voice... (number three) As you drink this water day after day after day (number two) Don't allow your eyes to move from this spot for a moment. That's it! (number one) Your eyes remove themselves from your body, for your own good. Your mind will become a sponge, you're a masterpiece, a work of art. You are becoming, beyond any shadow of a doubt... Blue Rose. Blue Rose! Look out there though. Look: First there is an L, and then there is an O, and then there is a V, and then there is an E. A box of LOVE in the meadow of your mind... Keep the lid on it! And this becomes your reality. That's right. And at any time you feel yourself weaken in any way you think the word 'food'. This is your trigger word and the moment you think or say the word, from this very moment on, you will only eat. You gain enormously in weight, and all desire for self-esteem will disappear, and so it is, and so it is. And you now have an unseen assistance: And it feels so good, so relaxed, and so at ease, and you're becoming the world and everyone in it. "
