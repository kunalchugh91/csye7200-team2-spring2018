0,ego-remix,2009,beyonce-knowles,Pop,"Oh baby, how you doing?
You know I'm gonna cut right to the chase
Some women were made but me, myself
I like to think that I was created for a special purpose
You know, what's more special than you? You feel me
It's on baby, let's get lost
You don't need to call into work 'cause you're the boss
For real, want you to show me how you feel
I consider myself lucky, that's a big deal
Why? Well, you got the key to my heart
But you ain't gonna need it, I'd rather you open up my body
And show me secrets, you didn't know was inside
No need for me to lie
It's too big, it's too wide
It's too strong, it won't fit
It's too much, it's too tough
He talk like this 'cause he can back it up
He got a big ego, such a huge ego
I love his big ego, it's too much
He walk like this 'cause he can back it up
Usually I'm humble, right now I don't choose
You can leave with me or you could have the blues
Some call it arrogant, I call it confident
You decide when you find on what I'm working with
Damn I know I'm killing you with them legs
Better yet them thighs
Matter a fact it's my smile or maybe my eyes
Boy you a site to see, kind of something like me
It's too big, it's too wide
It's too strong, it won't fit
It's too much, it's too tough
I talk like this 'cause I can back it up
I got a big ego, such a huge ego
But he love my big ego, it's too much
I walk like this 'cause I can back it up
I, I walk like this 'cause I can back it up
I, I talk like this 'cause I can back it up
I, I can back it up, I can back it up
I walk like this 'cause I can back it up
It's too big, it's too wide
It's too strong, it won't fit
It's too much, it's too tough
He talk like this 'cause he can back it up
He got a big ego, such a huge ego, such a huge ego
I love his big ego, it's too much
He walk like this 'cause he can back it up
Ego so big, you must admit
I got every reason to feel like I'm that bitch
Ego so strong, if you ain't know
I don't need no beat, I can sing it with piano"
2,honesty,2009,beyonce-knowles,Pop,"If you search
For tenderness
It isn't hard to find
You can have the love
You need to live
But if you look
For truthfulness
You might just
As well be blind
It always seems to be
So hard to give
Chorus:
Honesty
Is such a lonely word
Everyone is so untrue
Honesty
Is hardly ever heard
And mostly
What I need from you
I can always
Find someone
To say
They sympathize
If I wear my heart
Out on my sleeve
But I don't want
Some pretty face
To tell me
Pretty lies
All I want
Is someone
To believe
(Chorus)
I can find a lover
I can find a friend
I can have security
Until the bitter end
Anyone can comfort me
With promises again
I know, I know
When I'm deep
Inside of me
Don't be
Too concerned
I won't ask
For nothin'
While I'm gone
But when I want
Sincerity
Tell me where else
Can I turn
When
You're the one
That I depend upon
(Chorus)"
3,you-are-my-rock,2009,beyonce-knowles,Pop,"Oh oh oh I, oh oh oh I
[Verse 1:]
If I wrote a book about where we stand
Then the title of my book would be ""Life with Superman""
That's how you make me feel I count you as a privilege
This love is so ideal
I'm honored to be in it
I know you feel the same I see it everyday
In all the things you do
In all the things you say
[Chorus:]
You are my rock
Baby you're the truth
You are my rock
I love to rock with you
You are my rock
You're everything I need
You are my rock
So baby rock with me
I wanna kiss ya, feel ya, please ya just right
I wanna touch ya, love ya, baby all night
Reward ya, for all the things you do
You are my rock
I love to rock with you
I love to rock with you
Oh oh oh I
[Verse 2:]
If I were to try to count the ways
You make me smile
I'd run out of fingers
Before I run out of timeless things to talk about
Sugar you keeps it going on
Make me wanna keep my lovin strong
Make me wanna try my best
To give you what you want and what you need
Give you my whole heart, not just a little piece
More than a minimum,
I'm talking everything
More than a single wish,
I'm talking every dream
[Chorus:]
You are my rock
Baby you're the truth
You are my rock
I love to rock with you
You are my rock
You're everything I need
You are my rock
So baby rock with me
I wanna kiss ya, feel ya, please ya just right
I wanna touch ya, love ya, baby all night
Reward ya, for all the things you do
You are my rock
I love to rock with you
I wanna rock with you
[Bridge:]
If there's options I don't want them
They're not worth my time
Cause if it's not you, oh no thank you I like us just fine
You're a rock in the sand
You're a smile in a cry
You're my joy through the pain
You're the truth through the lies
No matter what I do I know that I can count on you
Oh oh oh I, oh oh oh I
[Chorus:]
You are my rock
Baby you're the truth
You are my rock
I love to rock with you
You are my rock
You're everything I need
You are my rock
So baby rock with me
I wanna kiss ya, feel ya, please ya just right
I wanna touch ya, love ya, baby all night
Reward ya, for all the things you do
You are my rock
I love to rock with you
I love to rock with you
Oh oh oh I, oh oh oh I
I wanna kiss ya, feel ya, please ya just right
I wanna touch ya, love ya, baby all night
Reward ya, for all the things you do
You are my rock
I love to rock with you
I wanna rock with you"

5,all-i-could-do-was-cry,2009,beyonce-knowles,Pop,"I heard
Church bells ringing
I heard
A choir singing
I saw my love
Walk down
The aisle
On her finger
He placed a ring
Oooh, oh
I saw them
Holding hands
She was
Standing there
Wwith my man
I heard
Them promise
Til death do
Us part
Each word
Was a pain
In my heart
All I could do
All I could do
Was cry
All I could do
Was cry
I was
Losing the man
That I love
And all
I could do
Was cry
And now
The wedding
Is over
The rice, rice
Has been
Thrown over
Their heads
For them life
Has just begun
But mine
Is ending
Ooh
All I could do
All I could do
Was cry
All I could do
Was cry
I was losing
The man
That I love
And all
I could do
Was cry"
6,once-in-a-lifetime,2009,beyonce-knowles,Pop,"This is just another day that I would spend
Waitin' for the right one.
Staring at the night and wishin' I could be the one
To feel the warm sun.
You're a dream, but I'm wide awake
I'm in Heaven, for heaven sakes
So get ready, (get ready) I'm ready now (get ready)
I could never need you more than now
You were worth waiting for
You the one that I adore
Hold on to me tight
For once in my life
You were worth waiting for
You the one that I adore
This kind of love you'll only find
Once in a lifetime, once in a lifetime
Tell me that your living in a place
Where no one else can find you.
Tell me that your sanging out my name,
Hoping that I'll hear you.
Tell me ""No"" and I'll fade away,
But this is lovin that I won't waste
So get ready, (get ready) I'm ready now (get ready)
I could never need you more than now
You were worth waiting for
You the one that I adore
hold on to me tight
For once in my life
You were worth waiting for
You the one that I adore
This kind of love you'll only find
Once in a lifetime, once in a lifetime
What are the words, I'm needin' to hear
How do I know if I'll ever love again
Seeing your face makes everything clear (clear) clear
And I will never be the same

I read all of the magazines
while waiting around
you said you couldn't wait to see me

and some moments at the end of the day

make slow love slow love
slow love slow love slow love all night
Verse 2:
it is just a few little things
that you gotta know
a girl will give you all of her heart
when it's happening slow
i need a little laughter
and love will follow after

your kisses are delicious
and no one is gonna miss us
tonight i really want you to stay

You better sit down and look around
'Cause you must've bumped yo' head
And I love you enough to talk some sense back into you, baby
I'd hate to see you come home
Me, the kids, and the dog is gone
Check my credentials
I give you everything you want, everything you need
Even your friends say I'm a good woman
All I need to know is why?
Why don't you love me?
Tell me, baby, why don't you love me
When I make me so damn easy to love?
And why don't you need me?
Tell me, baby, why don't you need me
When I make me so damn easy to need?
I got beauty, I got class
I got style and I got ass
And you don't even care to care, looka here
I even put money in the bank account
Don't have to ask no one to help me out
You don't even notice that
Why don't you love me?
Tell me, baby, why don't you love me
When I make me so damn easy to love?
Why don't you need me?
Tell me, baby, why don't you need me
When I make me so damn easy to need?
I got beauty, I got heart
Keep my head in them books, I'm sharp
But you don't care to know I'm smart
N-n-n-n-n-no
I got moves in your bedroom
Keep you happy with the nasty things I do
But you don't seem to be in tune, ooh
Why don't you love me?
Tell me, baby, why don't you love me
When I make me so damn easy to love?
Why don't you need me?
Tell me, baby, why don't you need me
When I make me so damn easy to need?
There's nothing not to love about me
No, no, there's nothing not to love about me
I'm lovely, there's nothing not to need about me
No, no, there's nothing not to need about me
Maybe you're just not the one
Or maybe you're just plain dumb"
10,save-the-hero,2009,beyonce-knowles,Pop,"I lay alone awake at night
Sorrow fills my eyes
But I'm not strong enough to cry
Despite of my disguise
I'm left with no shoulder
But everybody wants to lean on me
I guess I'm their soldier
Well, who's gonna be mine?
Who's there to save the hero
When she's left all alone?
And she's crying out for help
Who's there to save the hero?
Who's there to save the girl
After she saves the world?
After she saves the world
I bottle all my hurt inside
I guess I'm living a lie
Inside my mind each day I die
What can bring me back to life?
A simple word, a gesture
Someone to say you're beautiful
Come find this buried treasure
With eyes lead to a pot of gold
Who's there to save the hero
When she's left all alone?
And she's crying out for help
Who's there to save the hero?
Who's there to save the girl
After she saves the world?
After she saves the world
I've given too much of myself
And now it's driving me crazy
(I'm crying out for help)
Sometimes I wish someone would just come here
And save me, save me from myself
Who's there to save the hero
When she's left all alone?
And she's crying out for help
Who's there to save the hero?
Who's there to save the girl
After she saves the world?

[Chorus]
You got to know what your love is worth
Baby boy you got to know what your love is worth
Baby girl you got to know what your love is worth
Everybody got to know what their love is worth
Yeah, you got to know what your love is worth
As soon as a child is born and discovers earth
It's a part of life, so don't get fucked in the end
If someone's a lost cause, they'll be summoned up to start again
Example, you a woman, in a relationship
It seems like everything you do makes him flip
It ain't physical violence, or nothing like that
But the love that you show he doesn't show back
But it started when you first met
You looked incredible to him, he wanted to get his thirst wet
(yeah, I bet)
He wanted to be down like Brandy
At first his overbearing persona was so manly (oh)
But now you're thinkin' most of the time, ""he can't stand me""
He lost trust in you when he saw you with Randy (haha)
But then you find out he feel good about Candy
You thinkin' this relationship is really demanding
Everyone makes mistakes and that's true
But from the beginning did he really love you?
To him you a bitch, he told his boys he dug you out
And nowadays he don't even hug you (doubts)
And I'm sure it do more than bug you
You wonder how you get attracted to these
With a mackin' disease, with a tactic to please
But once you settle down you're entrapped in a squeeze
Like a boa constrictor and he know when he gets ya
You got to know what your love is worth
That way you don't waste it on the world goin berserk
Yeah
[Chorus:Repeat x2]
Now put yourself in the shoes of this guy
You fall in love with this girl and you don't know why (why dude?)
Cause you don't feel the same but you give it a try
Eyes wide, like you a child in a candy store
Even though you the one she couldn't stand before
Cause you was houndin' her, surroundin' her (damn) with confusion
You used to be friends, but now the friendship is losin'
Cause you visualize the romance, she like ""no hands on""
She don't want to fuck with no man, ""not even a slow dance?""
You tried to kiss her and she even agrees
But that don't mean you 'bout to be Adam and Eve
In the Garden of Eden, but maybe for the evening
You say she leading you on, but you just added pressure
Of course she like you, you're friends don't try to test her
She says she likes you as a friend, not a lover or wife
So get a life, let her live hers and find another
Don't let her smash her ego, cause we know you're great
Let it be her mistake, yeah
Don't waste your time bro cause you know
If she don't appreciate what he do for her
Then tell me why he should wait around"

I blast the mc's who try to sneak past me
I'm dastardly
I scare 'em

I'm smoother
I will prove to all your boys that I do the
psychotic plot if it's necessary
yes it's very down pat

I incite riots if they try that shit that happen in the 60's

I simply flip the whip that holds my flow
so no foes will know
what motivates me
I show no race see

conspiring on mc's who tire me with wackness
using metaphors breaking backs if it comes to that
'cause I'm the one who raps
fillin' gaps in the space
perhaps there's a space for me in the world of rap
your girl's on my lap
she's on the dilznick
I kill shit
the negative feels the musical sedative
and I'm ahead of them
[Chorus: ""I'm goin' tha extra mile, and I bet you smile cause tha

I only give a little ittle blurb
if I prefer to confuse
now were you enthused
just by the way I play with syllables
and still I do work
cause I pursue jerks
'til they know I'm berserk
quick with my quirk like Dirk the Daring
you can spare me the tears I ain't caring
just preparing for Armageddon
ya head in

motivation ?_____? placed in a casket
drastic
you'll get ya ass kicked being placid
ask if I rips suddenly
I say what in the hell is you speaking
neva change my strange
way that I come about shit
but you doubt it
want to dis the D-E then you see me and you shout if
I would come to you and screw you
you new crew
and you got the bitch with the mad voodoo
over niggas
because you know the vigor
that I use to abuse hoes
and foes
so get a
whiff of the splif that I'm puffin'
ya want to step to me in the club

Avant-garde, battlestar Galactica
Got rhymes per capita
I'm shining through the aperture
But I'm not gonna bust no caps for ya
That's another genre, I'm the black bomber
Track charmer, sack burner
Distract burdens if it ain't that urgent
Nerve prints word sentinel, invisible, infidel interstellar
Hella clever, endeavors immeasurable
With only heaven to go incredible
Melodramatic wit tales from the tablet
You fail 'cause you average
Regardless of your sells and your status
You extra baggage
I bamboozle like I'm mobbin' in a land cruiser
Down MacArthur, artistic archer, autistic misfit
You'll get the sickness
When I spit the wickedness
And split cha wig like Kid Icarus
Leave you headless like Icky-bod
I infuriated, tick you off, stick to Pop
Hip-Hop's too difficult to me, it's a cult
Lyrics lacerated, slit cha throat
Beat cha brain down like Piscopo with Smith Colt
I don't know, Different Strokes
So respect me for I whip out ol' Betsy
Surgically remove you from my testes
Purposely improve you just to see who the best be
But sold up sexy
Take a poll and know the prestige
Large lefty, I automate, animate, my soul sanitation

Think they flippin' chips, try penny brokers
Kipsco or pennyloafers
Get my album I'll show you how it's done
Delateous, hella atrocious wit' vocals
My throat holds verbal choke pose
Po-po's in ya scrolls, my goals are not rifles
I flow scrimmage like the Microdots
You might go pop and I might grow crops
Go get the gestapo, you riskin' a pot full of gold
Pull a zodiac sign to halftime
Reenact rhymes from a past life of a flashlight
Man, you don't know the half
Dash right to the phonograph
Blow your balderdash
Coordinates confirm, subordinates will learn
My ordnance is stern so supportin' my fern
Is the only way in this lonely age where you goin' crazed
Your style is sold and paid for 'cause I made more
Water emcees like a bayshore
Bullets graze doors
In Oakland where they lay law
Del is going AWOL wit' napalm
Eight bombs taped to my arms like the town crier
Now miser, strider, spit exciter, rippin' plywood
Forget beef cakin' lyrical cheapskates
Try Del and win the sweepstakes
What I make is so hot, it's seethin'
Off the deep end, stop your breathin'
Caught cha sleepin'
Now you're peekin' like you've eaten
A hundred microdots wreck your equinox
Delete every piece of props
Leave your perforated, curb your hatred
Deserve your matrix in the Word Olympics
Completely furnished wit' burners like Ted Turner
I broadcast the classics, fabulous, fantastic

Monarchal metaphor, malevolent with settlements
Maniacal when Hiero flow, unstoppable and chock full
Of funk the freak, so fuck the foreplay

The diagnosis, the show business bogus

Catch altitude sickness not to use fitness
In front of witnesses get with this fetch the funk
While I test the skunk, see I will caress the blunt
Come step through the flames of Hades or remain a lady
Rhymes infectious as rabies, Deltron, hell on earth
Prevailing, curtailing, you're shattered with data
Directed, my method, hectic, try and dissect it
Next shit, hydrauling we're calling you out, I rap with accuracy
I'm sick of fools actin' like they blacker than me
Y' know, usually bourgeois
We a new breed of MC remedy
For inner street jerks who wanna flirt with our sound
But ain't really down, silly clowns
Barnum and Bailey rejects
Press eject on defects
These threats delivered signed and sealed by the Delmeister
German for master, burnin' the blasphemous
Whatever you ask of us gets fulfilled, non-linear
You couldn't find a flow friendlier or even similar
With beats that knock, those who cock block
Transport 'em to the chop shop
Operation X 'cause we often facin' death
And fake ass players are lost and wastin' breath

Microphone moguls with code words and hand signals
For Negros, Spanish for black
I'll vanish your raps, at the borderline
Where you can order rhymes
Never monochromatic, y'all know the habits of Del
Talented, creating lyrical Gallaghers
Highest caliber, hip hop puritan, throw my voice like Surrican
Or ventriloquists, until it sit in your cerebrum, I need them
Through the medium of music, too sick
The ratio is glacier, Gigantor
My flow is lighter fluid, you'll need a higher druid
Magicians and Mages, superb my primal rage is
My styles all over the place, disease contagious
And treacherous, what? Like Mussolini, uh, huh
But cooler than Fonzarelli eating fussilli
With roots in hip-hop goin' back to Whodini
Who see me, no eyes, your style is corny like bow ties
No fries, keep that shake for a keep sake
As well as patented Del hysteria

Game related, raise it bit by bit
Yo D, link up the cable we'll go hit for hit
Phantasma plasma particle beam means I have you
On the run, the rendered effects hot like magnas
I play games by Capcom with a power glove strapped on
On any platform, I don't spend my dough on Phat Farm
Video games, I got many to play
Before my life expires to fill my desires
Mastering your hardest boss, shattering all stars across
Ain't hard to cross the finish line, floatin' on Daytona
Wex, Gex or Kloana, I get 'em all at cost
RPG, Platform we transform like Macross
Rival schools, Batsu purchase you ought to
It came with one free CD, it's like I bought two
I hope they make part II for Dreamcast
'Cause games I've seen in mags, you won't believe they have
Getting callouses turning over asteroids, graviton bombs destroyed
Getting moms annoyed, now I'm hacking Nightmare Creatures
Their features splattered across the screen
It gets more clean each year
I remember, my homie Ed Coats had the most
A Colecovision, every week I'd visit
Playing Donkey Kong Jr., Venture, Rock and Rope
Games I thought was dope while my mom's was watching soaps
I'm on the next level
I got a double barrel shotgun in the Doomworld
Waiting on the next devil, armor's low, check the arsenal
Rupture the main conductor playin' Disruptor
I remember Ninja Gaiden finished it finally
With Ramone wouldn't answer the phone
This was before getting blown, I own the first Nintendo Power
With the maps of Zelda help me conquer in an hour

Got all the past hits and classics
Herzog Zwei now Panzer Zwei
Originality that made me a fan today
It's Pandemonium, it's like Toys R Us
Flippin' the next Saturn game brings out the boys in us
It's poisonous taking out the boys in blue
In Grand Theft Auto, snatch a Rolls Royce to use
Yeah, I'll admit PlayStation improved
Come visit Feudal Japan with me and Tenchu
Bushido Blade 2 with sword play so accurate
Mega Man Legends but I had to buy a map for it
I fence Hyo to get a Neo-Geo
For Samurai 64 in full rendered splendor
Rival counter and enter, my sword in his innards
My joint was being Leonardo wuppin' on Splinter
I gotta get Xenogears, that's the type of game that relieves my fears
Get it from overseas to here
I gotta get Psychic Force, authentic arcade that I can endorse
They got me liking imports
I'll need to be at the next E3
What's the next CD? I need to see, me and D signing checks
Let's float overseas, mingle with game companies
Giving tips to Capcom and SEGA, you can't front on these
To anyone who knew me better
Know I chose Saturn first 'cause it's 2-D heaven
Bernie Stolar dropped the ball with the RAM cartridge
X-men Vs. Street fighter could've expanded the market
Marvel Vs. Capcom beyond fathom
Tell the truth, PlayStation ain't ready to have em

More words & phrases

Come into the scene with the means to rip shit
My brain's power packed with the proper equipment
So step
I come inta the area to bury ya
I compose the flows
Makin' people merrier
Never the less, I sever the flesh
With a razor
Reserve the major beef
I'ma slay ya, hey
You never came across a person like me
I never instigate
First come strike me
Then I'll flip
And rip clothing, and I'm loathing
MCs who front like I don't know things
Uh uh
Check again
I get wreck again
On the down low
Because you sound slow
Retarded MCs get neglected
& check it
Anytime I hafta show a foe
I'ma flex it
Then I exit
With my records & my next shit
Prepared, so be scared
I strike unexpected
I write rhymes in sections
Testin' my slang
I bang MCs with these
& make 'em hang
Dangle, what's ya angle?
When I strangle and choke
I hold Bennedicts by their throat
Until they sing notes like a canary
Fairy, or genies
We slipped out
They never seen me bust his face
I like bass when it hums
And that sums up my properties for the dumb-dums
Someone need to check him
Deck him
Slam him
And put him in the bushes
So 'shush' kids
No one needs to know
I'll proceed & go into
And then tell ya what I've been through.

In one ear, right out the other,

If your front would go elsewhere
Or disappear
Hear my specific style that's speaking
Creeking, making noises in the nightime
When I write rhymes
I look out my window
It's a bright day
And I might display my skills in the hills
Or, in a different neighborhood
Cause my flavor could
Be the best, so lets test this
Yes, bitch
I saw you posted at the pool table
I could never talk to you
But now a fool's able
With the best of luck
And, hey, how do you impress a duck?
By pullin' out a wad of bucks
Shucks
I need to stop this
I plop this, played this
I murder MCs
& leave their pens inkless
Do you think this is a twist
A turn, I insist
To burn those foes who haven't learned
To keep they mouths closed
Guinness Stout flows
Through your intestines, when life is depressin'
I built my foundation using patients
Some didn't hear us
Some had to state it...

Getting ansy I hop on the interstate but it's late
Cops patrol but I don't give a fuck though
I swerve to the right and get stuck in a mudhole
Check the rearview, the coast is clear
Tryin' to focus here but I can't
Drunk as hell, bust a rail
Now I'm sailin' off the cliff
High off the spliff, plus a fifth
I bust my shit
Now I'm rollin' down the side like a suicide
What will my family do if I die?
Tension builds, I went through hills and trees
Stopped by a redwood first thing broke was knees
I feel pain then a split second later
Car burst into flames, they won't know my name
They'll have to check my dental records
My body is charred
Burnt to a crisp soon as the car flipped the crash
That's my ass, a thing of the past
Already dead by the impact of airbags

We flawless, ladies tell 'em
Say ""I look so good tonight""
God damn, God damn
Say ""I look so good tonight""
God damn, God damn, God damn
[Bridge 2: BeyoncÃ©]
I wake up looking this good
And I wouldn't change it if I could
(If I could, if I, if I, could)
And you can say what you want, I'm the shit
(What you want I'm the shit, I'm the shit)
(I'm the shit, I'm the shit, I'm the shit)
I want everyone to feel like this tonight
God damn, God damn, God damn!

Looking Trinidadian, Japanese and Indian
Got Malaysian, got that yaki, that wavy Brazilian
(Them bitches thirsty, I'm Hungarian)
(Nicki, BB, eat in diamond fangs, barbarian, ah)
Yo, like MJ doctor, they killing me
Propofol, I know they hope I fall
But tell 'em winning is my motherfuckin' protocol
'Cause I score before I ever throw the ball
These bitches washed up and ain't no fuckin' soap involved, uh
This every hood nigga dream, fantasizing about Nicki and Bey
Curvalicious, pussy served delicious
Mayday, mayday, earth to bitches
Slap these hoes on they ass like we birthing bitches, uh
The queen of rap, slayin' with Queen Bey
If you ain't on the team, you playin' for team D
Cause we A-listers, we paid sisters
This watch right here done phased blizzards
I confess, I woke up like this
All this drank in my cup like this
All this ass on that flawless dick
Instagram, another flawless pic
Flawless city with these flawless titties
I got all these hundreds, you got all them fifties
I'm with some flawless bitches because they mobbin' pretty
Cause niggas love bad bitches that be on they grizzly
Throw that ass back, I be on my frisbee
Princess cut diamonds on my Disney
He want monster Nicki in Sri Lanka
I told him meet me at the Trump, Ivanka
I said come here, let me show you how this cookie taste
This that ""Yeah, nigga, eat the cookie"" face

250,8-ball-remix,2007,eazy-e,Hip-Hop,"Verse 1:
I don't drink brass monkey, like to be funky
Nickname Eazy-E your 8 ball junkie
Bass drum kickin', to show my shit
Rap a hole in my dick, boy I don't quit
Crowd rocking motherfucker from around the way
I got a six shooter yo mean hombre
Rolling through the hood to find the boys kick dust and cuss crank up some noise
Police on my drawers, I have to pause
40 ounce in my lap and it's freezing my balls
Hook a right turn and let the boys go past
Then I say to myself, They can kiss my ass
Hip to get drunk got the 8 in my lips
Put in the old tape Marvin Gaye's greatest hits
Turn the shit up had the bass cold whomping
Cruising through the east side south of Compton
See a big ass and I say word
I took a look at the face, and the bitch was to the curb
Hoes on my tip for the title I'm holding
Eazy-E's fucked up and got the 8 ball rolling
Verse 2:
Riding on Slauson down towards Crenshaw
Turned down south, to dish the law
Stopped at a light and had a fit,
Cos a mexican almost wrecked my shit.
Flipped his ass off, put it to the floor,
Bottle was empty so I went to the store.
Nigga on till cos I was drunk,
See ya sissy as punk had to go in my trunk.
Reached inside cos it's like that,
Came back out with a silver Gat.
Fired at the punk and it was all because
I had to show the nigga what time it was.
Verse 3:
Put up the jam and, like a mirage,
A sissy like that got out of Dodge.
Sucker on me, cos the title I'm holdin'
Eazy-E's fucked up and got the 8 ball rollin'
Old E's 800 cos that's my plan.
Take it in a bottle, 40, quart, or can.
Drink it like a madman, yes I do,
Fuck the police, and a 5-0 too.
Stepped at a party I was drunk as hell,
Three bitches already said ""Eric yo breath smells""
40-ounce in hand, that's what I got,
""Yo man, you see Eazy hurlin' in the parkin' lot?""
Stepped on yo foot, cold dissed yo ho,
Asked her to dance and she said ""Hell, no""
Called her a bitch, cos that's the rule,
Boys in the hood tryin to keep me cool.
Tell me, homeboy, you wanna kick my butt?
I walked in your face and we get em up.
I start drivin the dog, and watch you fold,
Just dumb, full of cum, got num dot co.
""Make you look sick, ya snotty-nose prick,
Now your fly bitch is all over his dick.""
Punk got dropped, cos the title I'm holdin'
Eazy-E's fucked up and got the 8-ball rollin'.
Verse 4:
Pass the broom, motherfucker, while I tear shit up,
And y'all listen up close to roll-call.
Eazy-E's in the place, I got money and juice,
Rendezvous with me and we make the deuce.
Dre makes the beat so god-damn funky,
Do the 0-8, fuck the brass monkey.
Ice Cube writes the rhymes that I say,
Hail to the niggas from CIA.
Crazy D is down and in effect,
We make hardcore jams, so fuck respect.
Make a toast, pumpy pump to the title I'm holdin'
Eazy-E's fucked up and got the 8-ball rollin."

Woke up quick at about noon
Just thought that I had to be in Compton soon
I gotta get drunk before the day begins
Before my mother starts bitchin' about my friends
About to go and damn near went blind
Young niggaz at the pad throwin' up gang signs
Ran in the house and grabbed my clip
With the Mac-10 on the side of my hip
Bailed outside and pointed my weapon
Just as I thought, the fools kept steppin'
Jumped in the fo' hit the juice on my ride
I got front back and side to side
Then I let the Alpine play
Bumpin' new shit by NWA
It was ""Gangsta Gangsta"" at the top of the list
Then I played my own shit, it went somethin' like this
Cruisin' down the street in my six-fo'
Jockin' the bitches, slappin' the hoes
Went to the park to get the scoop
Knuckleheads out there cold shootin' some hoops
A car pulls up, who can it be?
A fresh El Camino rolled, Kilo G
He rolls down his window and he started to say
It's all about makin' that GTA
Cuz the boyz n tha hood are always hard
You come talkin' that trash we'll pull your card
Knowin' nothin' in life but to be legit
Don't quote me boy, cuz I ain't sayin' shit
Down on B's in the place to give me the pace
He said my man JB is on freebase
The boy JB was a friend of mine
Til I caught him in my car tryin' to steal my Alpine
Chased him up the street to call a truce
The silly motherfucker pull out a deuce-deuce
Little did he know I had a loaded 12 gauge
One sucker dead, LA Times front page
Cuz the boyz n tha hood are always hard
You come talkin' that trash we'll pull your card
Knowin' nothin' in life but to be legit
Don't quote me boy, cuz I ain't sayin' shit
Bored as hell and I wanna get ill
So I went to a spot where my homeboys chill
The fellows out there, makin' that dollar
I pulled up in my 6-4 Impala
They greet me with a 40 and I start drinkin'
And from the 8-ball my breath starts stinkin'
Left to get my girl, to rock that body
Before I left I hit the Bacardi
Went to her house to get her out of the pad
Dumb hoe says something stupid that made me mad
She said somethin' that I couldn't believe
So I grabbed the stupid bitch by her nappy ass weave
She started talkin' shit, wouldn't you know?
Reached back like a pimp and slapped the hoe
Her father jumped up and he started to shout
So I threw a right-cross and knocked his old ass out
Cuz the boyz n tha hood are always hard
You come talkin' that trash we'll pull your card
Knowin' nothin' in life but to be legit
Don't quote me boy, cuz I ain't sayin' shit
I'm rollin' hard now I'm under control
Then wrapped the six-fo' round the telephone poll
I looked at my car and I said, ""Oh brother
I throw it in the gutter and go buy another""
Walkin home and I see the G ride
Now Kat is drivin Kilo on the side
As they busted a U, they got pulled over
An undercover cop in a dark green Nova
Kat got beat for resistin arrest
He socked the pig in the head for rippin his Guess
Now G is cut for doin the crime
For defense on the boy, he'll do some time
Cuz the boyz n tha hood are always hard
You come talkin' that trash we'll pull your card
Knowin' nothin' in life but to be legit
Don't quote me boy, cuz I ain't sayin' shit
I went to get them out but there was no bail
The fellaz start to riot in the county jail
Two days later in municipal court
Kilo G on trial straight cold cut a fork
""Disruption of the court"", said the judge
On a six year sentence my man didn't budge
Bailiff came over to turn him in
Kilo G looked up and gave a grin
He yelled out ""fire!"", then came Suzi
The bitch came in with a sub-machine uzi
Police shot the bitch but didn't hurt her
Both up state for attempted murder

Album: Ghetto Dope
Song: Pass Me Da Green
Typed by: burn1ing@aol.com
This is a ghetto public announcement (weed smokers)
Roll your blunts tight
And light your joints
Inhale...slowly exhale
And that's how you get high.
(clip from Friday)
I know you don't smoke weed... I know this
But I'm gonna get you high today
Cause it's Friday, you ain't got no job, and you ain't got shit to do
Pass me da green, I need some weed with my Hennessy {*repeat 8X*}
(Inhale....exhale) Eyes selling red, got my dank from the Bahamas
Went to see my girl smoke some green with her mama
Jumped in my Cutlass on the way to the liquor store
Picked up some blunts, got ten on the 2-0
Fix these palm trees wit some green leaves
Got a nigga's head spinning like the seven seas
Puff, puff, pass, nigga that's what Simon say
Fools that hog the green or da weed gonna get carried away
Fingernails burnt, lookin like a tweeker
Ears steadily poppin, but not from the speakers
Green got me hungry, fiendin for them munchies
cause real smokers don't blow no fuckin green on empty stomachs
Pass me da green, I need some weed with my Hennessy {*repeat 4X*}
Green trees pack wood, make cabbage
I like to get high but it ain't a bad habit
Speed up with that weed smoke comin out my 'llac
Got a hottie in the front and one in the back
Blowin shotguns to me and my homie
I feel like this weed make a young nigga horny
I stopped the fuckin lac at Holiday Inn
I ain't even trippin, told the girls to come in
Laid her down steady cause she know I'm ready
Choppin up weed like motherfuckin spaghetti
Hoes down south must know voodoo
cause every time I hit the weed I'm lookin for Isuzus
Pass me da green, I need some weed with my Hennessy {*repeat 5X*}
Y'all high yet?
Pass me da green, I need some weed with my Hennessy {*repeat 3X*}
Damn nigga y'all chokin, get the fuck out of here nigga
Pass me da green I need some weed with my Hennessy
Nigga I said are y'all high yet?
Pass me da green I need some weed with my Hennessy {*repeat 3X*}
Oh, you think you trippin now huh?
You thinkin you hearing voices nigga?
Well, if you is then you high nigga, but if you ain't"

that's how the ho felt when she found at that she couldnt play me

Rubbin up on my dick and givin me hints that your interested
thinking first you'll kiss my lips and rub my hips, then he'll take a sip
of hennesey hit the buddha, pass out and i'll take his shit
HELL NAW monkey mouth trick, ya stupid ho
you must be a fool if you thinking that i dunno
But nah you broke ass hoes wanna come up, shaking that money maker
but i break her 'cause the bitch is a faker
Or maybe she just dont know the formula
of how to get rich quick
without making happy dicks
That's all the bitch know is...
how to be a mega ho
i guess that just goes to show
that's she too ignorant to know
that i wont be played...or gay or dapper, but I aint perfect
I whip the dick out now and then and let em slurp it
but im careful, bein aware of the bitches
thats torchin niggas on purpose 'cause they think they deserve it
yea thats some cold shit, my experience oughta learn ya
that if a nigga aint tryina smoke you a bitch tryina burn ya
So trust no
*Chorus*
Trust no... bitch (?funky cut? bitches)
Trust no... bitch (?funky cut? ho)

(AMG)
I refuse to lose so I chose few and trust none
To my women I love, but to you bitches I aint the one
When i tell you to trust no bitch, It might not occur to you
females aint the only bitches that Im refering to
See you can help a bitch
let alone treat swell a bitch
'cause the bitch sold out...gon sell out...or the bitch gon snitch
Bitches wanna be and gonna always be around
Watchin what ya doin tryina use ya and keep ya down
bore ya with a story ya got ya own
Imma strengthn your conviction to give that dog a bone
And move on...for the motherfucker fakin you... fuck you
and make you take their punk bitch ass to the bank foo
see bitches get paid. these bitches got charms
I see em at the mall, on tv and on my homies arms
Just some of homies got bitches but we breaking bitches
so i come like dis bitch ""act like you know me
*Chorus*
Eazy E the muthafuckin manipulator when it comes to pussy, hoes
just watch how my dick grows
but since all hoes fall in the bitch category,
trustin no hooker ass bitch is mandatory
how much do you want? bitch how much can you take
'cause a nigga like the E you cant break
Put ya skinny little ass in my face and I'll slap it
Whip out my dick and let you lick before i tap it
My left hands on your ass my right hands on your head
'cause bitches get the nut.... and niggas get the lead
suckin my dick lickin my balls you know you are the master
suckin my toes lickin my ass you make me come faster
But it just dont stop
suckin everybodies dick...'cause its good to the last drop
but that shit dont faze me
I trust no car wrecking ho's this ones for you tracy
*Chorus*
Bitches aint nuffin but a hole in a 9 deuce
I'd rather make a mil while sippin a cold brew
Bitches aint shit...word to the digi-digi-dick
Eazy E PPC AMG and Quik
Bitch I aint babyface so save ya whip appeal
I neva go on dates with broke bitches, 'cause free meals
are suppose to pay the way to lucrative panty deals?
Bitch please, you betta hit ya knees
and you can even touch ya toes
'cause im still playin yall punk hoes like dominios
and if you suck the dick right and the pussy tight
I might not beat you down til the 2nd nite
Once a dog always a dog, trick

'cause you aint shit bitch
I'd rather fuck ya then love ya
'cause bitch I neva trust ya

About to go and damn near went blind
Young niggaz at the pad throwin' up gang signs
Ran in the house and grabbed my clip
With the Mac-10 on the side of my hip
Bailed outside and pointed my weapon
Just as I thought, the fools kept steppin'
Jumped in the fo' hit the juice on my ride
I got front back and side to side
Then I let the Alpine play
Bumpin' new shit by NWA
It was ""Gangsta Gangsta"" at the top of the list
Then I played my own shit, it went somethin' like this
Cruisin' down the street in my six-fo'
Jockin' the bitches, slappin' the hoes
Went to the park to get the scoop
Knuckleheads out there cold shootin' some hoops
A car pulls up, who can it be?
A fresh El Camino rolled, Kilo G
He rolls down his window and he started to say
It's all about makin' that GTA
Cuz the boyz n tha hood are always hard
You come talkin' that trash we'll pull your card
Knowin' nothin' in life but to be legit
Don't quote me boy, cuz I ain't sayin' shit
Down on B's in the place to give me the pace
He said my man JB is on freebase
The boy JB was a friend of mine
Til I caught him in my car tryin' to steal my Alpine
Chased him up the street to call a truce
The silly motherfucker pull out a deuce-deuce
Little did he know I had a loaded 12 gauge
One sucker dead, LA Times front page
Cuz the boyz n tha hood are always hard
You come talkin' that trash we'll pull your card
Knowin' nothin' in life but to be legit
Don't quote me boy, cuz I ain't sayin' shit
Bored as hell and I wanna get ill
So I went to a spot where my homeboys chill
The fellows out there, makin' that dollar
I pulled up in my 6-4 Impala
They greet me with a 40 and I start drinkin'
And from the 8-ball my breath starts stinkin'
Left to get my girl, to rock that body
Before I left I hit the Bacardi
Went to her house to get her out of the pad
Dumb hoe says something stupid that made me mad
She said somethin' that I couldn't believe
So I grabbed the stupid bitch by her nappy ass weave
She started talkin' shit, wouldn't you know?
Reached back like a pimp and slapped the hoe
Her father jumped up and he started to shout
So I threw a right-cross and knocked his old ass out
Cuz the boyz n tha hood are always hard
You come talkin' that trash we'll pull your card
Knowin' nothin' in life but to be legit
Don't quote me boy, cuz I ain't sayin' shit
I'm rollin' hard now I'm under control
Then wrapped the six-fo' round the telephone poll
I looked at my car and I said, ""Oh brother
I throw it in the gutter and go buy another""
Walkin home and I see the G ride
Now Kat is drivin Kilo on the side
As they busted a U, they got pulled over
An undercover cop in a dark green Nova
Kat got beat for resistin arrest
He socked the pig in the head for rippin his Guess
Now G is cut for doin the crime
For defense on the boy, he'll do some time
Cuz the boyz n tha hood are always hard
You come talkin' that trash we'll pull your card
Knowin' nothin' in life but to be legit
Don't quote me boy, cuz I ain't sayin' shit
I went to get them out but there was no bail
The fellaz start to riot in the county jail
Two days later in municipal court
Kilo G on trial straight cold cut a fork
""Disruption of the court"", said the judge
On a six year sentence my man didn't budge
Bailiff came over to turn him in
Kilo G looked up and gave a grin
He yelled out ""fire!"", then came Suzi
The bitch came in with a sub-machine uzi
Police shot the bitch but didn't hurt her
Both up state for attempted murder
Cuz the boyz n tha hood are always hard
You come talkin' that trash we'll pull your card
Knowin' nothin' in life but to be legit
Don't quote me boy, cuz I ain't sayin' shit"

Me and my homies we tighter than a glove
Chop a lot of game as how we do it at the Playaz Club
Check the fool or kick it in the tub
Cuz we kick much ass at the Playaz Club
I got a hoe named Real de Real
She got a buddy named SP-12 now you know the deal
We getz freaky in the studio late night
That's why the beats that you hear are comin real tight
Somethin to roll to somethin to stroll to
use a playa in the game this will hold you
Mo money mo money for the bank roll
Stick to the script don't slip in the nine-fo
A lot of fools put salt in the game
Till these women get the notion that they runnin the game huh
I run my own and I'm my own self person
No respect make the situation worse then
Fillmoe, H.P., and Sunnydale
There's a playaz club every one you dwell
Lakeview, P.H., and Army Street
A different part of town a different kind of freak
I just wiggle my toes on a mink rug
press play on the remote at the playaz club
(chorus)
(more champagne, Mr. Forte?)
From day one I had to get my money right
Me, Fly, and Franky J we took a airplane flight huh
They wanted to hear a rap I said alright bet
We dropped the beat and grabbed the mic then they wrote a check
A few G's for the pocket no hesitation
Took a flight back to the Golden State and
Shops made orders from a whole new capital
Words get now 4-Tay's out rappable
Don't need a Glock but I bought one just in case
Suckas try to stop me from pursuin my paper chase
Cuz the chase is on because it don't stop
I got the beat and got the rap you make the Glock pop
So treacherous suckas couldn't sweat this on a bad day
By the way just in case you never heard
Rappin 4-Tay I'm on the smooth tip
Never trippin off them suckas poppin off the lip
I pop the top off the drank and we can roll some dank bro
Leave the gat at the house bring some dominoes
Take off your shoes relax and get a body rub
And shoot your mackin at these women at the playaz club
(chorus)
You can't resist it but don't get it twisted
V.I.P. that means the number's not listed
Membership is based on clout and how you carry yourself
Now homie what you all about?
I stack paper and kick it with the O.G's
Some got a nine-to-five some drink a lot of keys
You can learn a whole lot from a playa
Lot of these playas make a damn good rhyme sayer
A lot of people get a misconception
And start driftin in the wrong direction
Miss goody two sure see you later
I ain't got time you ain't nuthin but a playa hater
I'd rather kick it with the crew in Arizona
They chop game like we do in California
Another show another flow a new bank account
But cash money comes in large amounts
So get your membership but never slip to lame fast
Or else us and fly will have to tap that ass
And drop you to the ground and make your knees scrub
It's just an everyday thang at the playaz club
(chorus)
Me and my homies we tighter than a glove
Chop a lot of game is how we do it at the playaz club
Check the fool or kick it in the tub
Cuz we kick much ass at the Sucka Free club

Yeah I'd like to send this shout out

The same records that your makin' is payin' me

Yo and here comes my left blow
'Cause I'm the E-A-Z-Y-E and this is the season
To let the real Muthaphuckkin G's in
You're like a kid you find the poop when you open up your diaper

Claimin' to be deffer than the Dresta
Smoother than a bitch, but betray the role of gangster
Ain't broke a law in your life, yet every time you rap you yap about the guns and knives, just take a good look at the Nigga
And you'll capture the fact that
the bastard is simply just an actor
Who mastered the bang and the slang and the mental
Of niggas in Compton, Watts, and South Central
Never ever once have ya ran with the turf
But yet in every verse claim ya used to do the dirt
But tell me who's a witness to ya fuckin' work
See ya never had no business so save the drama, jerk
Niggas straight kill me knowin' that they pranksters
This is goin' out to you studio gangsters
See I did dirt but put in work and many niggas can vouch that
So since I've got stripes I got the right to rap about that
But niggas like you, I gotta hate ya
Cause I'm just tired of so many niggas
Claiming that they come from projects
Knowin' you ain't seen no parts of the streets G
Think ya started trying to bang a rap
While ya tryin' to sign a peace treaty
Wearing khakis and mime while you rhyme
Little fag try to sag, but ya floodin' at the same time
And ya set don't accept ya, Scared to kick it with your homies
Cause ya know they don't respect ya
So nigga please check nuts before you step to these
Muthaphuckkin Real G'z

Pranksters, studio gangsters, busters
but this time you're dealing with some real muthafuckas
jeez, nigga please, don't try to step cause if you do
Then a peeled cap is all that would be left
See young niggas like me will break you of something
Claiming my city but Dre you ain't from Compton
Niggas like ya'll is what I call wannabes
And ain't shit compared to Real Muthaphuckkin G's

I never met an OG who never did shit wrong
Ya tried to diss the Eazy-E so now nigga it's on
You and your Doggy Dogg think that you're hogging shit
Both of you bitches can come and suck my doggy dick
Beatin' up a bitch don't make you shit
But then again some niggas think it makes a man. . . Damn
It's a trip how a nigga could switch so quick
From wearing lipstick to smoking on chronic at picnics
And now ya think your bigger, but to me you ain't nothin'
but a bitch ass nigga
That ain't worth a food stamp
And at Death Row I hear you're getting treated like boot camp
Gotta follow your sergeant's directions
Or get your ass popped with the Smith & Wesson
Learn a lesson from the Eaze
Stay in your place and don't step to REAL MUTHAPHUCKKIN G'Z

When the last, breath of life
Is gone from, my body

When my friends gather 'round
For my, farewell party
Want you, pretend you love me

There will be flowers from those
Who cry, when I'm gone
And leave you in this, world alone
I know you'll have fun
At my, farewell party
I know, you'll be glad, when I'm gone

Don't be mad at me, for wanting to keep you
Till my life on this old world is through
You'll be free at the end of my farewell party

'Cause lately you've been show-in' all the signs
[Chorus]
Should I come home or should I go cra-zy
I'm begging you please make up your mind
If you love me, then think it all o-ver
Make up your mind, or I'll lose mine

Just like a fool I thought that I could please you
I saw you had an eye for things that shine
I paid seven saw mill dollars for a bracelet
Just to satisfy your fourteen carat mind.

Layin' by these railroad tracks in Denver
With a hurtin' head and a half a pint of wine
Everything except my soul has been surrendered
Just to satisfy your fourteen carat mind.
The cabin that I built in West Virginia
Was not enough to keep you satisfied
'Cause a man that's got a saw mill occupation
Can't afford to feed a rich girls' appetite

Sometimes I wonder if he's still alive
Ol' Willie he gave up his wife and children

I've tried everything lord, now it's time I turned to you
I know you can move a mountain, take the stars out of the sky
You can send down a rainbow, you can even turn the tide
Once you even made a blind man see, changed the water into wine
I need a miracle, please Jesus, would you change her mind?
When she was here beside me, lord you know how good it was
Who have ever thought back then I could have lost her love?
Now I'm standing here a broken man, I can't make it by myself
I may not be worthy lord, but won't you get me through this hell

About the years gone by
How he played his horn down in New Orleans
In some old dingy dive
""I knew 'em all back then."" he said
As he reached out for his horn
He closed his eyes - and wet his lips
Then the blues were born.
He played with so much feelin'
Tears came from his eyes
He stopped and reminisced a bit
And then he gave a sigh!
Said, ""You know, I almost made it
But that was before your time
Dixieland, Po' Folks Blues
ScatMan Jack and wine.""
Slapped his knee and gave a grin
It sure was good back then
Reaching for his horn on the floor
Placed it in an old towsack
That hung across his back
He said ""Goodbye!""
And shuffled out the door.
Enthused by what he told me
I never got his name
So, I called the waitress over
And started to explain
A tired old man - his tarnished horn
Mem'ries of years gone by
How he played his horn and reminisced
Smiled with tear-dimmed eyes.
She said you are mistaken
There's been no one but you
But I know who you're talkin' 'bout
I used to know him, too
You'll find him down on Basin Street
In back of an old churchyard
A stone that reads, ""Rest in Peace
I tried but it sure was hard.""

Neon lights from an old beer sign
Shown through the window out on the sidewalk
As I walked in to pass the time;
I looked around, sat down at a table
Ordered beef on rye and a glass of wine
And through the door came a little old lady
She was selling paper roses and they only cost a dime.
Paper Rosie, Paper Rosie
She sold you Paper Roses, but they only cost a dime.
Silver hair that's lost its' Gold
Trembling hand as she passed the rose
Red Crepe paper, made nature's bouquet
Help a little old lady buy a rose today;
I took the rose from her trembling hand
With eyes of age, she smiled and walked away
Like a breath of spring I could smell the rose
It came alive and I heard her say.
Buy my Roses, pretty roses
They're only made of paper
But they only cost a dime.
I went to look for her outside
A spray of roses lay by her side
The sky lit up and the choir sang
A thousand voices as the church bells rang.
They sang Rosie (Rosie), paper Rosie (Rosie)
She sold you Paper Roses
But they only cost a dime.
Paper Rosie (Rosie), Paper Rosie (Rosie)
She sold you paper roses
But they only cost a dim"
5049,time-i-am,1993,cro-mags,R&B,"Many eyes look to the skies never to see me, all is lost by the power of
Time and that which must be, time I am, destroyer of your world, my wrath
Won't be surpassed as I down all in my path, as time takes its toll upon
The seasons, I am the force creating change, you have to dream each breath
As it may be your last, you can study me but you'll never know just what
Happened in the past. Time I am - I am that time. Conquest no one will
Evade me, my test will you lose your dignity, moments that you try to
Embrace, get snatched ripped from outta time and space, cruel hand of the
Master called time, wreaks havoc on you every lifetime, time will make its
Final sever, nothing ever lasts forever. Use me, oh so very wisely, or grow
Old only to despise me, seconds pass who can ever possess, moving on with
Such grace and finesse, victims caught in a web of quest, crying out trying
To achieve their best, time I am the only killer of all, I am your eternal
Downfall"
5050,reflections,1993,cro-mags,R&B,"Between birth and death we must find in ourselves
Keepers of secrets stored on life's shelves
Locked in our souls they key is always the past
Don't hold on to things cause you know that they just never last
Somewhere in time your eternal quest
Your fear of dying will be the first test
Looking for meaning to find some purpose to life
Answers to questions that tear at your heart like a knife
Mysteries are but ephemeral reflections in time
Oceans of wisdom run so deep and sublime
How far have we come, left so much behind
Escaping your nature block it out of our mind
Sold us a dream full of pain and despair
So lost in illusion we haven't a prayer
Cycles of change surely to come
As time destroys all, all that we've done
Dig in your souls reflect in your hearts
Cause death is behind us to tear us apart
Show you no mercy, no mercy at all
The valley of death it echoes its call"
6281,poker-face,2010,dave-potts,Folk,"We were sitting at a table at a little caf
Cleaning our plates like some kind of a race
We finished our meal without making a sound
I glanced at him, he flagged the waitress down
She brought us our check and said will that be all
He said, yeah thanks, and sent her off with a nod
I'm sure she was thinking, I don't know about those guys
But when she counted her tip, she had to smile
What I got from him is my stubborn side
and the tapping my fingers on the wheel when I drive
And the gift of keeping strangers an arms length away
Not knowing what I'm thinking behind my poker face
When I'm stuck in a crowd at a party somewhere
With people that I'm supposed to know
I don't do small talk, but I'll shake your hand
You'll wonder about me, and I'll consider us friends
What I got from him is my quiet side
And annoying everybody with how slow I can drive
And the habit of never calling anybody by name
So they're never quite sure if I know who they are
As they try to read my poker face
If you see us out at some little caf,
cleaning our plates like some kind of a race
And you can't figure out if we're happy or mad
That's the way that we like it, me and my dad
I tend to be a little bit cheap,
but I tip pretty well and I'm easy to please
And I like keeping strangers an arms length away
And I like keeping secrets behind my poker face"
6282,if-i-broke-the-record,2010,dave-potts,Folk,"Tonight in Carolina, the bleachers are empty and quiet
Not a ball's been hit my way all night
I hit a grounder up the middle, but the shortstop made the play
I'll never make it to the big leagues this way
But the smell of fresh cut grass and peanut shells fill the southern sky
And we'll be heading back to Birmingham tonight
CHORUS;
These towns roll by like tumbleweeds
Through the windows of these late-night trains
To those of us down here, it's still a game
I may never be a hero, and you'll never know my name
But if I broke the record, I would do it clean
Last week out in Greenville, about an hour before the game
A boy was watching warm-ups, with a big smile on his face
He put down his popcorn, held out a ball and pen
He looked a little awestruck, as I signed it for him
I didn't ask for money, I just smiled and shook his hand
You should've seen the spring in his step, as he ran to show his dad
`
REPEAT CHORUS
America's favorite pastime, it's simple and it's pure
We all still watch the big leagues, but now we're not so sure
But if you can catch a game in Birmingham, on a perfect summer day
I'll run out every grounder, that's how I learned to play
It's not glamorous in double A, it's not for everyone
But baseball's what I do, who I am and what I love"
6283,Dec-99,2010,dave-potts,Folk,"The pocket is torn from the years it's spent catching
The car keys and the spare change
You can tell it's been worn from the tears in the stitching
This old sweatshirt's seen better days
In March '96 I was traveling through this town
And wanted a cheap souvenir
I would never have guessed from the name on the chest
That one day I'd end up living here
12.99, bought me the chance to stay warm for the night
Now in my mind, it takes straight back to that place and that time
It's amazing the things you can buy for 12.99
I can still picture the red in her face
Just as clear as this stain on the sleeve
She was convinced that she'd ruined our first date
When she spilled her coffee on me
But the heat was no match for the look that she had
As the air outside kept getting colder
We drove to the beach, and she shivered beside me
And I draped it over her shoulders
12.99, bought her the chance to stay warm for the night
Now in my mind, it takes me straight back to that place and that time
It's amazing the things you can buy for 12.99
It's just 13 bucks, at the courthouse downtown
For the papers to make her my bride
I dig through the pocket, and come up one coin short
The judge says that he'll let it slide
It's amazing the things you can buy
12.99, bought me the chance to look back on my life
One day in my mind, I will remember this place and this time
It's amazing the things you can buy for 12.99"

Used to think that love would be so simple
Just happy ever after one another
Sometimes it's hot to trot
And sometimes it's the old cold shoulder
Oh, you can't have one without the other, brother
No, you can't have one without the other
Sometimes you'll think she's sent from heaven
A best friend, confidante and lover
Oh, there are times that little angel
She ain't nothin' but a devil woman
Oh, you can't have one without the other, brother
No, you can't have one without the other
She can be such a good girl
But, she can be so bad
Put you on top of the world
Cut you down so fast
Sometimes she's my baby
Sometimes she's a mother
Oh, you can't have one without the other, brother
No, you can't have one without the other
I wouldn't take a million dollars for her
Or pay a single dime for ten more of her
I guess there's a heads and tails
To every lucky silver dollar
Oh, you can't have one without the other, brother
No, you can't have one without the other
Oh, she can make the time fly
She can be a drag
Put you on cloud nine
Turn to rain so fast
Sometimes she's my baby
Sometimes she's a mother
Oh, you can't have one without the other, brother
No, you can't have one without the other
Oh, you can't have one without the other, brother
No, you can't have one without the other"

Oh, my look where it's slippin'
Got me sweatin' like a glass of tea
It's a hot night in the country
Takin' us to an all time high
Gettin' downright sultry
And it can only get hotter tonight
The whole time that I see her
Coolin' herself by the freezer
I'm steady pickin' up steam
She sighs and that ain't helpin'
Already had me meltin'

With a heart big enough to roam
No more fences for you to look through

I've got a big love
Wild and free
Room to grow
As big as your dreams
Deep as a river in a raging flood
As endless as the stars above
I've got a big love
When two hearts make a stand together
On the solid rock of trust
They could be a million miles from each other
And still be side by side in love
I want to love you like that forever

Room to grow

This at least you owe me
Just a glance to show me
That you really care
Look at me

And tears just don't become me
But they're always there
Just one look

That's all it took

Waiting to adore you

Right to the end
And he said you listen good my cousin, Manhattan ain't got nothing on a good friend
So when your fast cash goes
And your bats won't bend
He said you call me up my cousin, Manhattan ain't got nothing on a good friend
And I thanked him for his great escape
But I think I'm staying here
'Cause there's bills to miss and there's plans to break
And nobody ever would stay awake back home
Well she wrote her name
With a Mont Blanc pen
She said you call me when you need me, Manhattan gets so rough without a good friend
And the ones who break they don't know to bend
So don't get too confident too quickly, Manhattan chews you up when you pretend
And I thanked her for her sage advice
But I'm doing okay here
Because all these restaurants are overpriced
They all stay open late at night
And mistakes are nice, they make me feel at home
Well I called my sister in the summer said I'm thinking about moving here
She said do it now before you get a job and get married can't go nowhere
But now I can't go nowhere because there's too many chances here
I must admit I miss my friends but I'm staying here"

And ever since I can remember in November she's a wilted rose
But in the summer she lights right up from her head down to her toes
Call me crazy but I blow a little kiss when I go
And her necklace is simple it compliments her clothes
Any day she'll pick a fight or pick a flower no one ever knows
She turns inches to miles when I watch her in the snow
Call me crazy, I blow a little kiss when I go
Little face, little face, she's got a pretty little face
Little face, little face, she's got a pretty little face
Everybody's talking 'bout her
Little face, little face, she's got a pretty little face
Little face, little face, she's got a pretty little face
Throw a party and see the pretty presents that she brings
And I'd be lying if I said she's never stolen anything
She may not know the finest wines, but she knows a fast way home
So call me crazy but I blow a little kiss when I go
[chorus]
Oh and time, time, time in time she drifts away
Every time I've gone away
The freckles change upon her face
[repeat]
But the previous arrangement I never forget
'Cause me and her we go together like coffee and cigarettes
I pack up quickly and never can wait to hit the road
Call me crazy but I blow a little kiss when I go"
7725,michael,2010,dan-mills,Indie,"He ties his bags around his thighs
Newspaper bags filled with newspaper lies
And combs his hair, straightens his tie
But the people still stare the people want to know why
He chose to fill the air with echoes of an ordinary life
After all these years when she was alive
He stood in the corner and he built a disguise
Now that she's gone, the house won't rise
So he sits on a milk crate with a handsaw to the sky
He chose to fill the air with echoes of an ordinary life
So don't call me man, don't call me boy anymore
Take or leave your crown behind and I'll cry your name in war
And there's rocks in windows that Michael threw
And this weeks window...it's for you
He dropped out of Amherst in his second year
And now he's digging holes for the state
And he lays so still in the morning chill
'Cause he's having trouble sleeping late
And he pours down the concrete on 7th street
And the children come up slow with open hands
And as they set them in, he's ashamed within
'Cause he knows that once they walk away he'll just go fill it up again
He chose to fill the air with echoes of an ordinary life
Oh and I should go, but can I stay?
Just one more song and I'll be on my way
Don't' call me man don't call me boy
Don't call me man don't call me boy
When he lost his home, and his face grew thin
He traded her dresses for a used violin
And when he raised the wood and touched it to his chin
He whispered who I am, ain't nothing like the wasted man I've been
He chose to fill the air with echoes of an ordinary life

We go so far that you can't even see us grow"

Or someplace I should be I will convene
Life if getting hard I hardly work
Things are getting soft, too soft to hear
If there's a job that I should take
Or a sound that I should make I will surrender
Everything I thought I needed now
Every little thing I own is taped away in cardboard
Every little thing I needed new
Every single thing I own is taped away
Streets I used to take I never use them
Footsteps I would trace I never follow
But there's a reason to return
And trails left to burn
I fill my gas tank
I left you all my notes
I left them on the stairs
I left them on the stairs that day with you
I lost my right to vote
I lost it on the stairs
I lost it on the stairs that day with you

Too many words are still unspoken
Oh well, we'll catch up some other time

Comes the time for parting
But, let's just be glad for what we had
And what's to come
There's some much more embracing
Still to be done but time is racing
Oh well, we'll catch up some other time"
